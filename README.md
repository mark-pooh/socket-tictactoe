---------------------
This program used server of ip address 192.168.1.10. If you wish to change the host, please do so at line 
```String serverAddress = (args.length == 0) ? "192.168.1.10" : args[1];```

This line appears twice, in ```Client.java``` and ```ClientAI.java```

You need to have Java SDK installed and added to the environment variables (Please google on how to add java to environment variables)
