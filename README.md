P/S: 	This program used server of ip address 192.168.1.10. If you wish to change the host, please do so at line
     	String serverAddress = (args.length == 0) ? "192.168.1.10" : args[1]; //change the ip address here
	This line appears twice, in Client.java and ClientAI.java

	You need to have Java SDK installed and added to the environment variables (Please google on how to add java to environment variables)
